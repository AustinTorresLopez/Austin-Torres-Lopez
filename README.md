##Hi ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Austin Torres Lopez, and I enjoy backend development, alongside algorithm analysis, as my side interest. Recently, I have enjoyed learning more about the Spring framework, and feel comfortable with Java development. I enjoy programming in C for its powerful creative use and python for more simple tasks.
